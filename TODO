TODO list for midikbd:

 - Better documentation.
 - Wait for device if not present.
 - wait for jack if not present.
 - Add device and other startup options to config file.
 - Non-blocking device read:
	* to make LEDs work if other end changes their state
	* Make flashing available (9 LED states instead of 6)
 	* so we can remove delay from read loop.
 - Add *.desktop file... this would require a gui first so that the user can
 	see midikb is running
 - Add GUI to edit config...
 - Deal with modifier keys so that two can be used at once (like shift/ctl/something)
	* This is working right now so long as ctl and shift are hit in the right order
	* It would be nice to save modifier state so there is never a resend and only
		the new key is sent.
