* Why yet another keyboard daemon ?

Because I needed a daemon that:

- is small and simple
- is NOT X Window based, so that it's usable even from the console
- can execute external programs
- can handle key combinations


* What about the other daemons ?

I had a look at the following:

- lineakd:
    pros: modules
    cons: X-based

- pbbuttonsd:
    pros: not X-based (IIRC)
    cons: could not find how to execute external programs, Mac-centric,
	bloated with PM and other non-keyboard stuff.

- esekeyd
    pros: not X-based, executes external programs, keyboard detection
    cons: does not support key combinations

    I used a modified (i.e. with limited combination support) esekeyd
    for quite some time, until I decided to write my own daemon.

- keyed
    pros: not X-based, executes external programs
    cons: no repeat/release event support, no device detection

- evkeyd
    pros: not X-based
    cons: no external program execution, no key combinations


* What does the name mean ?

Simply that actkbd ACTs on KeyBoarD events. Or maybe that it is an ACTing 
KeyBoard Daemon. Or...


* Does it work ?

It is now launched at boot time on my system and it seems to work without any
problems. I will still have to receive quite a bit of feedback before I mark it
as stable, though.


* How does it work ?

To find out read the `Internals' section in the README. Then read the source 
code itself for details.


* Are release events useful ?

Yes, I think so. A common example could be that of a battery monitor. You want 
it to appear when you press a key and then disappear (i.e. be terminated) when 
you release it, without having to manually kill it each time.


* I found a bug !

Good! Now report it at <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>... or even better fix it and 
send a patch!


* How can I help ?

- Test it.
- Report any bugs.
- Ideas, suggestions e.t.c. are welcome. Patches even more!
- Occasionally you may drop a line to say that it worked for you. Positive
  feedback is just as important.


* I don't like your coding style

I don't like yours either.


* Who wrote it ?

Me, Theodoros Kalamatianos, a student at the department of Electric and Computer 
Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. For purposes related 
to actkbd I may be reached at <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>.


* Under what license is it released ?

Naturally, the GNU General Public License. The full text of the GPL is included 
in the actkbd tarball.
